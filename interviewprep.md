- understand > rote learning (use both)
- questions + one solid project + on demand videos

- whenever i watch sometiems video it's like i am not concetrating
- when should i start attending interviews ?

- That hits deep, Nather. You’re not lazy or dumb—it’s just **how your brain is wired**.
- **Linux distros + strategy games** = **Instant feedback**, trial-error, discovery, progress.
- **Interview prep** = **Abstrac==t**, slow feedback, no fun until job offer.==
    
      
    You like systems that **respond** and **reward exploration**. Interview prep is dry, delayed reward.

- Fix: turn interview prep into a "strategy game"
- Break down prep into _small missions_ (like daily dailies).
- Track XP (topic covered) & skill level (confidence score).
- Treat topics like “units” or “resources” to manage.
    
      
    Want me to turn your Java/Spring prep into a game-style tracker?  
    

- Start attending interviews when you have:
- ✅ Minimum Prep Done:
- **Core Java** solid (OOP, collections, exceptions, threads)
- **Spring Boot** (REST APIs, annotations, DI, lifecycle)
- **Project explanation** – confidently explain your past work
- **Basic DSA** – at least easy-medium LeetCode type
- **1–2 mock interviews** – to kill nervousness
- Opinion:
    
      
    Start even **before you're 100% ready**. Real interviews = best feedback + pressure training.  
      
    Just don’t wait forever for "perfect readiness".  
      
    Start now if you're **70% prepped** and can learn fast in parallel.  
    

- Sure Nather, here’s your **most minimal and impactful prep** in bullet points:
- ✅ Practice real interview Q&A (Java + Spring Boot)
- ✅ Write your own answers in a doc (build daily)
- ✅ Build & polish 1 mini Spring Boot REST project
- ✅ Link project to concepts (DI, REST, error handling, etc.)
- ✅ Do 1 mock interview per week (self or with someone)
- ✅ Apply to jobs every week (don’t wait to feel ready)
- ✅ Watch short videos **only when stuck**
    
      
      
    That’s it. Stick to this, you’ll get results.  
      
    Gotcha  
    now, Nather. You’re asking _what kind of prep method_, not topics.  
    Here's the **minimal-impactful combo** that can realistically get you a  
    job fastest:  
      
    
    ---
    
- **1. Focus: Interview Questions > Projects > Videos > Books**
- **80% time: Solve interview Qs (Java + Spring Boot based)**

- Real Qs from Glassdoor, GitHub repos, company-wise
- Practice answers, write code, revise

- **15% time: Build 1 mini project**

- Just 1 REST app using Spring Boot + JPA + basic CRUD + validation
- Reuse this to explain concepts in interview

- **5% time: Watch videos (only for gaps)**

- e.g., “How @Autowired works?” – just in time, not binge
    
      
      
    
    ---
    

- **Avoid:**
- Books – too slow
- Too many tutorials/projects – waste of time
- Trying to be “perfect” – unnecessary
    
      
      
    
    ---
    
- TL;DR Strategy:
    
      
    
    > **Solve real Qs + explain 1 mini project + fill gaps with videos**  
    > = Job in least time.  
    
      
    Want a weekly plan using this combo?

    Alright  
    Nather, here’s your **refined, minimal-impact prep plan**—optimized to  
    get a Java + Spring Boot job in a service-based company fast:  
      
    
    ---
    
- **1. Core Focus (Daily - 2 to 4 hrs)**
- **Interview Questions (60%)**

- Solve + write answers (Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, etc.)
- Maintain your own doc – subjective + coding questions
- Revisit + refine older Qs (build depth)

- **Project-Based Concept Linking (20%)**

- One solid mini project
- Use it to explain real-world app flow (REST, DB, error handling)

- **Mock Interview Practice (10%)**

- Weekly: 1 self-mock or with friend/ChatGPT
- Focus on explaining, not perfection

- **On-Demand Learning (10%)**

- Only watch 1 short video **if** you get stuck/confused
- No binge-watching or course hopping
    
      
      
    
    ---
    

- **2. Weekly Actions**
- Apply to jobs (even if not fully ready)
- Update resume with your project
- Reflect: What did you struggle to answer? Fix that next week.

- Rule of Thumb:
    
      
    
    > **Don’t prepare everything. Prepare what you're likely to say out loud in an interview.**
